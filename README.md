# Shell Fun
Hi, this is where I mess around with weird things I find in the GNU/Linux Shell

### Note
If you want to run these on your own system (without the `bash [file]`) syntax, modify the top shebang, `#!/usr/local/bin`, in these files because I use zsh, while you might be using the Bash shell or another type.
